My own extensions for InertSteak's Pokermon mod for Balatro

Currently adds:

- Glimmet and Glimmora as jokers

Glimmet and Glimmora's signature ability sets Toxic Spikes whenever they get hit. I figured it'd be interesting to have them as jokers that set more hazards over time. Sadly having both Glimmet and Glimmora scale caused many issues, so you'll have to evolve Glimmet first to benefit from the power of exponential hazards. I don't think it's too overtuned, but if I get proven wrong it should be simple to nerf it.
