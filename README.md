# Pokermon-Maelmc

My own add-on for InertSteak's Pokermon mod for Balatro

## Jokers

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Glimmet | +2 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>+4 Chips per Hazard in hand |
| Glimmora | +2 Hazards per 10 cards in deck, Decreases cards needed by 1 for each 25 Hazards triggered<br/>+8 Chips per Hazard in hand |

Glimmet and Glimmora's signature ability sets Toxic Spikes whenever they get hit. I figured it'd be interesting to have them as jokers that set more hazards over time. Sadly having both Glimmet and Glimmora scale caused many issues, so you'll have to evolve Glimmet first to benefit from the power of exponential hazards. I don't think it's too overtuned, but if I get proven wrong it should be simple to nerf it.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cufant | +1 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>Turns 1 Hazard to Steel at end of round |
| Copperajah | +1 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>Turns 3 Hazard to Steel at end of round<br/>+3 Mult per Steel in full deck |
| Gmax Copperajah | +1 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>Turns 5 Hazard to Steel at end of round<br/>+6 Mult and x0.1 Mult per Steel in full deck |

Gmax Copperajah's MAX move sets a unit entry hazard, Steelsurge, which is basically Stealth Rock but Steel type. So I figured, turning hazards into Steel cards for this family fits. Each stage turns 2 more Hazard into Steel, and gives more Mult based on the amount of Steel cards you have. Since it keeps increasing the size of your deck, it synergizes well with anything that want a large deck. It also generates Steel cards to work with stuff like Magnezone or Aggron.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Odd Keystone | Does nothing<br/>Collects souls after selling jokers or consumables or destroying cards<br/>The rarer the joker sold, the more souls are collected<br/>Evolves after collecting 108 souls
| Spiritomb | +108 Chips, +108 Mult, -3 Hand Size<br/>Becomes Negative if you have 108+ cards |

The Odd Keystone is an item that does nothing, but Spiritomb is a powerful joker that can almost solo win any run so you have to commit a lot to get it. Maybe eventually I'll give it a real effect, but I like it as is.

Spiritomb is connected to the number 108 a lot, but 108 of anything in this game is a lot. I figured a Stuntman that also gives mult in exchange for even less hand size can make for an interesting joker. Having 108 cards in the deck feels improbable, but you can try to abuse hazards for example as once it's negative it won't lose it.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Gym Leader | Nature: Type<br/>Creates a tag and an Energy card after clearing a Boss Blind |

In french, Balatro tags are called badges and that's how I got the idea for this Joker. The energy's type is determined when the Joker is created, so if you get it in the early game you can try to focus your run on this type specifically and have guaranteed energies.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Kecleon | Gains +6 Mult whenever it changes Type |

Kecleon was the first Pokémon with an ability that changes type (Color Change) and the first one to have both. I think it's fitting that whatever it does, it does so when changing type. Didn't have much idea though, so I gave it +6 mult per type change.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Lunatone | 1 in 4 chance for each card in poker hand to become Clubs<br/>1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand |
| Solrock | 1 in 4 chance for each card in poker hand to become Hearts<br/>If a non-Hearts card didn't turn to Hearts, 1 in 4 chance to enhance it to Wild |

They mimic the effects of their matching Tarot and Stone cards. Simple yet effective idea, as turning cards to a specific suit makes Flushes easier to get, and it also synergizes well with 

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Inkay | 50% of cards are drawn face down<br/>Gives +8 Mult when a face down card is scored |
| Malamar | All cards are drawn face down<br/>Gives x1.5 Mult when a face down card is scored |

Inkay and Malamar are all about being upside down. I figured it'd be an interesting mechanic to draw cards face down but getting a good boost in exchance. At first I had Inkay at x1.5 and Malamar at x2 but it proved to be a bit too good, so I nerfed it to be what it is now.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Binacle | Retriggers the first 2 7s in poker hand and cards held in hand |
| Barbaracle | Retriggers the first 7 7s in poker hand and cards held in hand |

One thing I noticed about Pokermon is the lack of options to retrigger cards held in hand. There's Mr. Mime that retriggers the first twice, Gigalith that retriggers Hazards and that's it. So I got this idea of Binacle and Barbaracle, retriggering 7s because Barbaracle is made of 7 entities.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ralts | +1 Mult per hand level above 1|
| Kirlia | +2 Mult per hand level above 1|
| Gardevoir | X0.1 Mult per hand level above 1|
| Mega Gardevoir | Holding 2 Negative Black Hole |

A family of Joker that encourages raising all hand levels. Mega Gardevoir generates 2 Black Hole for each time you Mega it, so the idea is to mega, unmega, mega again etc etc to scale Gardevoir itself very quickly as long as you don't require the Mult Gardevoir is giving.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Gible | If played hand is a Pair, retriggers rightmost 2 cards held in hand and they give +2 Mult each |
| Gabit | If played hand is a Pair, retriggers rightmost 4 cards held in hand and they give +3 Mult each |
| Garchomp | +1 hand size<br/>If played hand is a Pair, retriggers all cards held in hand and they give +4 Mult each |
| Mega Garchomp | +2 hand size<br/>If played hand is a Pair, retriggers all cards held in hand of the same rank as the Pair and they give X1.5 Mult each|

All pseudo legendaries are based on a specific hand. On the Pokermon Discord server, I found a cool idea with the Garchomp line retriggering cards held in hand if hand played is a pair, so that's what I based this family on, with some adjustements compared to the original idea.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ogerpon | Holding Negative Leaf Stone<br/>Increases earned money at the end of round by \$2 for each Lucky card that triggered (starts at \$2)<br/>Retriggers all Lucky cards |
| Ogerpon Wellspring | Holding Negative Water Stone<br/>Scored Bonus cards give X3 their total chips then permanently gain +30 Chips |
| Ogerpon hearthflame | Holding Negative Fire Stone<br/>Each played Mult [rank] of [suit] gives X3 Mult when scored (card changed every round)<br/>If first played hand has exactly 1 card, destroy 2 random non-Mult cards held in hand|
| Ogerpon Cornerstone | Holding Negative Hard Stone<br/>Stone cards count as their own rank<br/>Scored Stone cards give + Mult equal to 1/10 of their total chips |

Each Ogerpon has 2 effect that encourages playing cards with a specific enhancement: Lucky, Bonus, Mult and Stone.
Teal is an incredible econ joker as it can scale very quickly and absurd amounts of money.
Wellspring scales the chips of Bonus cards, and they also give even more chips when scored. It can result in very high amount of chips.
Hearthflame is basically The Idol, but it'll only look for Mult cards in your deck which means it's much easier to predict on which card it'll land each round. It's also self enabling as it destroys cards.
Cornerstone is more gimmick than the rest. It allows to play Pair, Two Pair, 3oak, Full House, 4oak and 5oak using Stone Cards, which can help for synergises. It also gives Mult based on the stone cards' chips to help scoring.

All 4 are subject to change in the future, especially Hearthflame since between the Mask and the Fire Stone you create a lot of Mult cards which goes against the fact you want to have as few different mult cards as possible for its effect, and Cornerstone since it might be a bit too weak right now.


## Consumables

| Item | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Teal Mask | Enhance 3 selected cards to Lucky Cards |
| Wellspring Mask | Enhance 3 selected cards to Bonus Cards |
| Hearthflame Mask | Enhance 3 selected cards to Mult Cards |
| Cornerstone Mask | Enhance 3 selected cards to Stone Cards |

They can only appear if you have an Ogerpon that doesn't match the mask (ex: Teal Mask can only appear if you have Ogerpon Wellspring, Hearthflame or Cornerstone, not Teal), as they're used to change Ogerpon's form.

## Decks

| Name | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Hazard Stack | Starts with Glimmet<br/>Adds +1 Hazard per 10 cards in deck at the start of blind |

Hazard Stack is an hazard-focused deck that would get more hazards in general than any other deck.

## Challenges

They are not challenges in the sense that they are not challenging. It's just a way to test the different jokers I created. Some might be a bit weird since I use challenges to test the Jokers.
