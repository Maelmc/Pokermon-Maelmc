# Pokermon-Maelmc

My own extensions for InertSteak's Pokermon mod for Balatro

## Jokers

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Glimmet | +2 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>+4 Chips per Hazard in hand |
| Glimmora | +2 Hazards per 10 cards in deck, Decreases cards needed by 1 for each 20 Hazards triggered<br/>+8 Chips per Hazard in hand |

Glimmet and Glimmora's signature ability sets Toxic Spikes whenever they get hit. I figured it'd be interesting to have them as jokers that set more hazards over time. Sadly having both Glimmet and Glimmora scale caused many issues, so you'll have to evolve Glimmet first to benefit from the power of exponential hazards. I don't think it's too overtuned, but if I get proven wrong it should be simple to nerf it.

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cufant | +1 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>Turns 1 Hazard to Steel at end of round |
| Copperajah | +1 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>Turns 3 Hazard to Steel at end of round<br/>+4 Mult per Steel in full deck |
| Gmax Copperajah | +1 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>Turns 5 Hazard to Steel at end of round<br/>+4 Mult and x0.1 Mult per Steel in full deck |

Gmax Copperajah's MAX move sets a unit entry hazard, Steelsurge, which is basically Stealth Rock but Steel type. So I figured, turning hazards into Steel cards for this family fits. Each stage turns 2 more Hazard into Steel, and gives more Mult based on the amount of Steel cards you have. Since it keeps increasing the size of your deck, it synergizes well with anything that want a large deck. It also generates Steel cards to work with stuff like Magnezone or Aggron.

## Decks

| Name | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Hazard Stack | Starts with Glimmet and Cufant<br/>Adds +1 Hazard per 10 cards in deck at the start of blind |

Hazard Stack is an hazard-focused deck that would get more hazards in general than any other deck. Of course, it starts with Glimmet and Cufant so you get to try them a bit. You can also just sell one of the two at the start if you want to try one specifically.

## Challenges

They are not challenges in the sense that they are not challenging. It's just a way to test the different jokers I created.
