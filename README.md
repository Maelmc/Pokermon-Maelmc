# Pokermon-Maelmc

My own extensions for InertSteak's Pokermon mod for Balatro

## Jokers

| Joker | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Glimmet | +2 Hazards per 10 cards in deck<br/>+4 Chips per Hazard in hand |
| Glimmora | +2 Hazards per 10 cards in deck, Decreases cards needed by 1 for each 20 Hazards triggered<br/>+8 Chips per Hazard in hand |

Glimmet and Glimmora's signature ability sets Toxic Spikes whenever they get hit. I figured it'd be interesting to have them as jokers that set more hazards over time. Sadly having both Glimmet and Glimmora scale caused many issues, so you'll have to evolve Glimmet first to benefit from the power of exponential hazards. I don't think it's too overtuned, but if I get proven wrong it should be simple to nerf it.

## Decks

| Name | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Hazard Test | Starts with Jynx, Glimmet, Glimmora, Gigalith, Golurk |
| Hazard Stack | Starts with Glimmet<br/>Adds +1 Hazard per 10 cards in deck at the start of blind |

The first one is just if you want to have fun with hazards and test Glimmet and Glimmora.

The second is more serious, it's an hazard-focused deck that would get more hazards in general than any other deck. Of course, it starts with Glimmet.
